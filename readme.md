**Important!** Currently application is under development. This comment will 
be removed after the first release.

Name `dorg` came from shortcut from "downloads organizer". I'd like to create a
tool which would automatically organize, in particular, my downloads catalog.

I'm aiming for this program to be:
* Using as little resources as possible 
* Requiring as little configuration as possible
* Portable
